## Research Interests

Current objects of study are topics in algebraic topology related to equivariant stable homotopy theory and categorical algebra, in particular: equivariant operads, dendroidal sets, model categories, and structured ring spectra.

Recent and ongoing work includes:
* investigating topological and spectral commutative monoids up to homotopy in the equivariant setting
* exploring the impact of these structures on cohomology theories, and computing examples (by hand and using Macaulay2)
* developing the homotopy theory of equivariant operads
* building new combinatorial models for equivariant operads up to homotopy

In addition to these projects in pure mathematics, other projects and interests include:
* model energy expenditure during graded walking
* visualization, analysis, and generation of four-part baroque choral music

We construct a generalization of the operadic nerve, providing a translation between the 1-categorical equivariant operadic world to the parametrized infinity-categorical perspective. This naturally factors through genuine equivariant operads, another model for homotopical equivariant operads. Moreover, we introduce the notion of a fibration of genuine equivariant operads, extending Grothendieck fibrations, and characterize the fibrant operads as the image of genuine equivariant symmetric monoidal categories. Finally, we show that under the operadic nerve, the image of genuine monoidal categories are G-symmetric monoidal G-infinity-categories.

We introduce the analogues of the notions of complete Segal space and of Segal category in the context of equivariant operads with norm maps, and build model categories with these as the fibrant objects. We then show that these model categories are Quillen equivalent to each other and to the model category for $G$-$\infty$-operads built in a previous paper. Moreover, we establish variants of these results for the Blumberg-Hill indexing systems. In an appendix, we discuss Reedy categories in the equivariant context.
