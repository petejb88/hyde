### Research Interests

I am interested in topics in algebraic topology related to equivariant stable homotopy theory, in particular equivariant operads, structured ring spectra, and model category theory. Recent work has included indexing G-operads on finite G-sets, and exploring N-infinity operads and conjectures of Michael Hill and Andrew Blumberg.

### Current Research Topics:

* **Presenting G-Operads**:

Using the Mandell-May presentation of orthogonoal G-spectra as motivation, I have found a way to present operads in G-spaces as monoids in an enriched functor category, which can be evaluated on any finite G-set. This gives us a more complete picture of the behavior of these operads, and may lead to new developments in defining model structures and exploring algebras over G-operads.

We can also define the category of G-operators, extending the original category of operator used in K-theory machines. The structure of their algebras is also under review.

Moreover, this story can be given in a general categorical case. The precise structures needed on a target category are currently being investigated.

* **Exploring N-infinity Operads**:

N-infinity operads, defined by Blumberg-Hill, describe the lattice of flavors of "equivariant E-infinity" structures. In particular, algebras over N-infinity operads have an incomplete set of norm maps, ranging from only the trivial ones (naively E-infinity) to all of them (G-E-infinity). Blumberg-Hill related these operads to subcoefficient systems of (-)-Sets with particular properties called indexing systems, and showed that N-infinity operads are uniquely determined (up to homotopy) by their associated indexing system. However, I have shown that their conjectures for how to realize any indexing system as an operad are false.

On that front, in the best case scenario we would be able to construct categorical models, as in Guillou-May-Merling, in order to build new N-infinity algebras, and do a similar analysis.

Separately, we would like to understand how the Boardman-Vogt tensor product acts on N-infinity operads. In particular, we would like to be able to understand precisely how the norms present themselves in the structure of the N-infinity operad.
