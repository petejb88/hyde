### Teaching Experience

I am teaching a section of Applied Calculus II this Fall, and I have previously lectured and TA'd various mathematics courses at the University of Viriginia. As an instructor, I am responsible for writing and giving lectures, assigning and grading homework, writing and grading exams, and assigning letter grades for each course; as a teaching assistant, I was responsible for running an hour-long discussion section, as well as writing, administering, and grading a quiz, each week.
