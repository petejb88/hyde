            <p>This course is designed for students who: are interested in majoring in Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Economics, or Accounting; and have <i>not</i> received a 4 or 5 on the AP Calculus exam for either AB or BC.

        <h2 id="sec-2">Course Description</h2>
        <div id="text-2" class="outline-text-2">
          <p>Math 135 is an introduction to the tools and techniques of Calculus. In particular, the main focus of the course is the study of real-valued functions of a single variable. The subject will be approached from both a conceptual and a computational viewpoint. Rather than just learning a set of formulas, techniques, and algorithms, the theory and applications of calculus will be central to our study. Additionally, the course will also require you to effectively communicate your solutions.</p>
          <p>You will investigate the following ``big questions'':</p>
          <ul class="org-ul">
            <li>What are common functions used to model the change in one quantity or value when it is determined by another quantity or value?</li>
            <li>What functions can we use to model smoothly-changing motion? For an object in motion, how do we measure the change in position for that object at a given instant in time?</li>
            <li>What are the important mathematical properties of functions that model smoothly-changing motion? What mathematical techniques can we use to analyze those functions and develop models with them?</li>
            <li>What phenomena can we model using derivatives and elementary functions?</li>
            <li>For an object that is continuously changing position, how do we determine the total change of position during a period of time?</li>
            <li>How do we compute the area of a two-dimensional figure with a curved boundary?</li>
            <li>How can we use polynomials to approximate more complicated functions?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By the end of the semester, you will be able to:</p>
          <ul class="org-ul">
            <li>set up and solve word problems</li>
            <li>explain the results and context of your computations</li>
            <li>interpret formulas and processes</li>
            <li>clearly communicate your solution process.</li>
            <li>collaborate and produce work with others</li>
            <li>investigate new definitions and theorems with examples and counterexamples</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="sec-2-1">The ``Flipped'' Classroom</h3>
          <div id="text-2-1" class="outline-text-3">
            <p>To encourage the growth of these skills and learning outcomes, this course will be using a ``flipped classroom'' style of instruction. The majority of our class time together will consist of working on guided worksheets or projects in small groups. There will be less traditional lecturing so that active student learning is the primary focus.</p>
            <p>While working in groups:</p>
            <ul class="org-ul">
              <li><i>Share responsibility for making sure all voices are heard</i>:<br />If you tend to have a lot to say, make sure you leave sufficient space to hear from others. If you tend to stay quiet in group discussions, challenge yourself to contribute so others can learn from you.</li>
              <li><i>Understand that we are bound to make mistakes in this space</i>:<br />Everybody (myself included!) does so when approaching complex tasks or learning new skills. In particular, you are invited to step outside your comfort zone!</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
        <h2 id="sec-3">Homework and Assessments</h2>
        <div id="text-3" class="outline-text-2">
          <p>This flipped classroom approach will be complemented by the out-of-class assignments.</p>
          <p>There will be three types of homework:</p>
          <ul class="org-ul">
            <li><strong>Daily Homework, due at the start of every class:</strong><br />In order to prepare for active in-class learning, there will be an assignment due at the start of every class. These will take the form of <i>Modules</i> on the Canvas page for this course. Typically, these will include an introduction to the topic of the day, usually by either a short video lecture or a link to an online visualization, and a short Canvas quiz on the introduced material.</li>
            <li><strong>WebAssign Weekly Homework, due on Wednesdays at 1159pm EST.</strong><br />There will be weekly assignments on <a href="https://www.webassign.net/wa-auth/login">WebAssign</a>. To access WebAssign, you will need a <i>class key</i>:<br /><strong>holycross <span>&nbsp;5407 7680</span></strong>.<br />You will have free access to WebAssign for two weeks. After that, you will need to purchase access, either bundled with a physical textbook, or online directly through WebAssign.</li>
            <li><strong>Written Homework, due every Friday at 1159pm.</strong><br />The written homework will consist of a small number of more-involved problems. These will be submitted as Canvas Assignments. You may submit these assignments to Canvas however you wish: print, fill out, and scan; fill out electronically; or write answers on a blank piece of paper and scan. Canvas will only accept PDF documents. There are apps to convert from pictures to PDFs, or take pictures as PDFs, if necessary.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additionally:</p>
          <ul class="org-ul">
            <li><strong>Quizzes, every Monday at the start of class.</strong> <br />Each Monday will begin with an in-class, video-on quiz. It will be conducted through Canvas, and will be time-limited.</li>
            <li><strong>Projects.</strong> <br />Instead of traditional exams, you will complete 3 take-home projects throughout the semester, and one after. These will be week-long assignments, completed with a partner. During the weeks these are due, there will be no quizzes or written homework.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Late assignments will <strong>not</strong> be accepted. However, only the 10 best scores of each type (WebAssign, Written, Quiz) will count towards your final grade.</p>

          <h3 id="sec-3-1">Grading</h3>
          <div id="text-3-1" class="outline-text-3">
            <p>Grades will be assigned based on the following scheme:<br />Participation &mdash; 30% <br />WebAssign &mdash; 15% <br />Written Homework &mdash; 15%<br />Quizzes &mdash; 20%<br />Projects &mdash; 20%</p>

        <div id="text-4" class="outline-text-2">
          <p>I know this is a weird and difficult time for us all. I expect myself to work hard to make this class effective and flexible, and I expect you to do the same.</p>
          <p>Math 135 students are expected to complete their assignments, come to class on time and ready to participate and engage with the material and their fellow classmates.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you are responsible for announcements made in class, as well as any emails sent to your UK email account or announcements on the course website.<strong></strong></p>

          <div id="text-4-1" class="outline-text-3">
            <p>Attendance is required. That being said, I expect there may be times where you are not able to make it to class, for a potential variety of health or personal reasons. If you must miss class, due to an illness or other pressing circumstance, please let me know as soon possible. I will not ask for medical documentation, and naturally the Class Deans are not going to be able to provide excused absences. Instead, I will trust your judgement and voice in these matters, and expect that you will take ownership of this trust and act responsibly.</p>
            <p>As listed above, participation is <strong>30 percent</strong> of your grade this semester. That includes the Daily Homework and attendance, as well as in-class work and engagement. Your effect and energy into our class time together is essential to this course. You get out what you put in; this grading scheme codifies that numerically.</p>

          <h3 id="sec-4-2">Cameras</h3>
          <div id="text-4-2" class="outline-text-3">
            <p>You may have considerations that will prevent you from keeping your camera on during our synchronous meetings, including internet speed or access issues, family responsibilities, or personal discomfort, so you may absolutely leave your camera off if you want or need to do so. To the extent that you are comfortable and able to turn your camera on, though, please feel free to do so (and be mindful of what's within your camera's view or which virtual background you're using!). This will help us to create a sense of connection and community in our class and encourage engagement with and trust in one another.</p>
            <p>Please try, however, to mute your microphone unless you are actively speaking or would like to offer a thought or question. This is to ensure that we give due focus to whoever is speaking and to avoid being distracted by unintended background noise.</p>
            <h3 id="sec-4-2">Recording</h3>
            <p>Recording of the class sessions is not allowed, except with the explicit written permission by me, as part of an accommodation through the Office of Accessibility Services.</p>

            <p>The College of Holy Cross (<a href="https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) and the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (<a href="https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/mathematics-and-computer-science/node/211581/academic-integrity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) both have policies on Academic Integrity. Please read these in full. By taking this class, you assume responsibility towards following this policy.</p>

            <h4 id="sec-4-3-1">Collaboration</h4>
            <div id="text-4-3-1" class="outline-text-4">
              <p>Mathematics is an inherently collaborative and social activity. On all of the homework assignments, you are encouraged to work together. However, the solution you submit for credit <strong>must be your own work</strong>. In particular, you should prepare your formal solutions to the written assignments independently, and you should submit your answers for web homework independently.</p>
              <p>You are <strong>not</strong> allowed to work together on quizzes, nor use books, notes, the internet, etc.</p>
              <h3 id="sec-4-1">Homework and Assessments</h3>
              <div id="text-4-1" class="outline-text-3">
                <p>The intention of the homework in this class is twofold: first, to have you practice the skills we learned in class, and get comfortable using the math technology we develop; and second, to apply those skills to new problems and different situations. We will not cover every type of problem that is on the WebAssign or Written Homework in a class worksheet or a daily homework, and that is <strong>by design</strong>. Adapting your knowledge to new scenarios is a valuable asset. Being able to effectively use the resources available to you --- office hours, the textbook, your fellow students --- will be key to your success in this class. Part of my role is to help foster these skills, in addition to teaching you math.</p>

          <div id="text-4-4" class="outline-text-3">
            <p>It is my job to provide all students with an accessible learning environment. Some aspects of this course, the assignments, the in-class activities, and the way the course is usually taught may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make me aware of your needs, we can work with the <a href="https://www.holycross.edu/health-wellness-and-access/office-accessibility-services">Office of Accessibility Services</a> to determine appropriate accommodations. Any information you provide is private and confidential, and will be treated as such.</p>
            <h3 id="sec-4-4">Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
            <p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed a a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.</p>

            <li>Even if you think you are good at multitasking, you work better when you focus on a single task.</li>
            <li>Just because the first approach at a problem does not work, does not mean that the second or third will not. Sometimes the first thing you (or I) try doesn't work, but this does not necessarily mean that you do not understand the tools required to solve the problem.</li>
            <li>Start your homework sets early and work together! You should make major progress over the weekend so that you can ask questions in class and/or office hours.</li>
            <li>Start the WebAssign early. The first few will be easy, but they will get harder!</li>
